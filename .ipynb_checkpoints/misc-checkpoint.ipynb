    "Crucially, says project leader Andrea Mello, this so-called \"flip-flop qubit\" means the chips can be produced using the same device technology as existing computer chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This makes the building of a quantum computer much more feasible, since it is based on the same manufacturing technology as today’s computer industry,\" Mello said.\n",

    "That would allow chips for quantum computers to be mass-manufactured, a goal that has so far eluded other researchers.\n",

    "Researchers who warned half a dozen robot manufacturers in January about nearly 50 vulnerabilities in their home, business and industrial robots, say only a few of the problems have been addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers, Cesar Cerrudo and Lucas Apa of cybersecurity firm IOActive, said the vulnerabilities would allow hackers to spy on users, disable safety features and make robots lurch and move violently, putting users and bystanders in danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "While they say there are no signs that hackers have exploited the vulnerabilities, they say the fact that the robots were hacked so easily and the manufacturers’ lack of response raise questions about allowing robots in homes, offices and factories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Our research shows proof that even non-military robots could be weaponized to cause harm,\" Apa said in an interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"These robots don’t use bullets or explosives, but microphones, cameras, arms and legs. The difference is that they will be soon around us and we need to secure them now before it’s too late.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the robot manufacturers defended themselves, saying they had fixed some or all of the issues raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apa’s comments come in the wake of a letter signed by more than 100 leading robotic experts urging the United Nations to ban the development of killer military robots, or autonomous weapons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apa, a senior security consultant, said that of the six manufacturers contacted, only one, Rethink Robotics, said some of the problems had been fixed. He said he had not been able to confirm that as his team does not have access to that particular robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A spokesman for Rethink Robotics, which makes the Baxter and Sawyer assembly-line robots, said all but two issues - in the education and research versions of its robots - had been fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apa said a review of updates from the other five manufacturers - Universal Robots of Denmark, SoftBank Robotics and Asratec Corp of Japan, Ubtech of China, and Robotis Inc of South Korea - led him to believe none of the issues he had raised had been fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asratec said that software released for its robots so far was limited to \"hobby use sample programs\", and it believed IOActive was pointing to security vulnerabilities in those. Software it planned to release for commercial use would be different, it said.\n",
    "\n",
    "SoftBank Robotics said it had already identified the vulnerabilities and fixed them. Ubtech said it had \"fully addressed any concerns raised by IOActive that do not limit our developers from programming\" their robots.\n",

    "Universal Robots did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Robotis Inc declined to comment.\n",

    "The slow reaction by the robot industry was not surprising, said Joshua Ziering, founder of Kittyhawk.io, a commercial drone software company. \"A new technology bursts on to the market and people fail to secure it,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALARMING THREAT\n",
    "\n",
    "Cybersecurity experts said the robot vulnerabilities were alarming, and cyber criminals could use them to disrupt factories by ransomware attacks, or with robots slowed down or forced to embed flaws in the products they are programmed to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The potential impact to companies, and even countries, could be massive,\" said Nathan Wenzler, chief security strategist at AsTech, a San Francisco-based security consulting company, \"should an attacker exploit the vulnerability within the applications that control these robots.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in the home, danger lurks, said Apa, demonstrating how a 17-inch (43.18 cm) tall Alpha 2 robot from Ubtech could be programmed to violently jab a screwdriver.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Maybe it’s small and it’s not really going to hurt right now, but the trend is that the robots are going to be more powerful,\" he said. \"We tested industrial ones which are really heavy and powerful, and some of the attacks work with them.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Apa and Cerrudo released their initial findings in January.\n",

    "\n",
    "Robots are big business: by 2020, the industry will have more than doubled to $188 billion, predicts IDC, a consultancy. But there’s still a lot that today’s models can’t do, partly because they are mostly made of rigid metal or plastic.\n",

    "A recent academic conference in Singapore showcased the latest advances in soft robotics, highlighting how far they are moving away from what we see as traditional robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The theme here,\" says Nikolaus Correll of Colorado University, \"is a departure from gears, joints and links.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One robot on display was made of origami paper; another resembled a rolling colostomy bag. They are more likely to move via muscles that expand and contract through heat or hydraulics than by electricity. Some combine sensing and movement into the same component - just as our fingertips react to touch without needing our brain to make a decision.\n",

    "Of all the technologies Rolls-Royce is exploring to solve this bottleneck, \"this is the killer one,\" says Oliver Walker-Jones, head of communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The snake, says its creator, Arnau Garriga Casanovas, is made largely of pressurized silicone chambers, allowing the controller to propel and bend it through the engine with bursts of air. Using soft materials, he says, means it can be small and agile.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, much of the commercial action for softer robots is in logistics, replacing production-line jobs that can’t yet be handled by hard robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Food preparation companies and growers like Blue Apron, Plated and HelloFresh already use soft robotics for handling produce, says Mike Rocky, of recruiter PrincetonOne.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge, says Cambridge Consultants’ Nathan Wrench, is to overcome the uncertainty when handling something - which humans deal with unconsciously: figuring out its shape and location and how hard to grip it, and distinguishing one object from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This is an area robots traditionally can’t do, but where (soft robots) are on the cusp of being able to,\" said Wrench.\n",
    "\n",
    "MARINE INSPIRATION\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors are excited, says Leif Jentoft, co-founder of RightHand Robotics, because it addresses a major pain point in the logistics industry. \"Ecommerce is growing rapidly and warehouses are struggling to find enough labor, especially in remote areas where warehouses tend to be located.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hope to ditch the idea that robots need hands. German automation company Festo and China’s Beihang University have built a prototype OctopusGripper, which has a pneumatic tentacle made of silicone that gently wraps itself around an object, while air is pumped in or out of suction cups to grasp it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean has inspired other robots, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "A soft robot fish from China’s Zhejiang University swims by ditching the usual rigid motors and propellers for an artificial muscle which flexes. It’s lifelike enough, says creator Tiefeng Li, to fool other fish into embracing it as one of their own, and is being tested to explore or monitor water salinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "And Bristol University in the UK is working on underwater robots that generate electrical energy by foraging for biomatter to feed a chain of microbial fuel-cell stomachs. Hemma Philamore says her team is talking to companies and environmental organizations about using its soft robots to decontaminate polluted waterways and monitor industrial infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn’t mean the end of hard-shelled robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the problem, says Mark Freudenberg, executive technology director at frog, a design company, is that soft materials break easily, noting that most animatronic dolls like Teddy Ruxpin and Furby have rigid motors and plastic casings beneath their fur exteriors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be sure, the nascent soft robot industry lacks an ecosystem of software, hardware components and standards - and some companies have already failed. Empire Robotics, one of the first soft robot gripper companies, closed last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "RightHand’s Jentoft says the problem is that customers don’t just want a robot, but the whole package, including computer vision and machine learning. \"It’s hard to be a standalone gripper company,\" he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "And even if soft robots find a niche, chances are they still won’t replace all the jobs done by human or hard-shelled robots.\n",

    "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The WannaCry malware that spread to more than 100 countries in a few hours is throwing up several surprises for cybersecurity researchers, including how it gained its initial foothold, how it spread so fast and why the hackers are not making much money from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some researchers have found evidence they say could link North Korea with the attack, but others are more cautious, saying that the first step is shedding light on even the most basic questions about the malware itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "For one thing, said IBM Security’s Caleb Barlow, researchers are still unsure exactly how the malware spread in the first place. Most cybersecurity companies have blamed phishing e-mails - e-mails containing malicious attachments or links to files - that download the ransomware. \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s how most ransomware finds its way onto victims’ computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem in the WannaCry case is that despite digging through the company’s database of more than 1 billion e-mails dating back to March 1, Barlow’s team could find none linked to the attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Once one victim inside a network is infected it propagates,\" Boston-based Barlow said in a phone interview, describing a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows that allows the worm to move from one computer to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NSA used the Microsoft flaw to build a hacking tool codenamed EternalBlue that ended up in the hands of a mysterious group called the Shadow Brokers, which then published that and other such tools online. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the puzzle is how the first person in each network was infected with the worm. \"It’s statistically very unusual that we’d scan and find no indicators,\" Barlow said.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Other researchers agree. \"Right now there is no clear indication of the first compromise for WannaCry,\" said Budiman Tsjin of RSA Security, a part of Dell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how malware infects and spreads is key to being able to stop existing attacks and anticipate new ones. \"How the hell did this get on there, and could this be repeatedly used again?\" said Barlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "PALTRY RANSOM\n",
    "\n",
    "Some cybersecurity companies, however, say they’ve found a few samples of the phishing e-mails. FireEye FEYE.N said it was aware customers had used its reports to successfully identify some associated with the attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the company agrees that the malware relied less on phishing e-mails than other attacks. Once a certain number of infections was established, it was able to use the Microsoft vulnerability to propagate without their help. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other surprises, that suggest this is not an ordinary ransomware attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only paltry sums were collected by the hackers, according to available evidence, mostly in the bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were only three bitcoin wallets and the campaign has far earned only $50,000 or so, despite the widespread infections. Barlow said that single payments in some other ransomware cases were more than that, depending on the victim. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jonathan Levin of Chainalysis, which monitors bitcoin payments, said there were other differences compared to most ransomware campaigns: for instance the lack of sophisticated methods used in previous cases to convince victims to pay up. In the past, this has included hot lines in various languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so far, Levin said, the bitcoin that had been paid into the attackers’ wallets remained there - compared to another campaign, known as Locky, which made $15 million while regularly emptying the bitcoin wallets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"They really aren’t set up well to handle their bitcoin payments,\" Levin said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of sophistication may bolster those cybersecurity researchers who say they have found evidence that could link North Korea to the attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "A senior researcher from South Korea’s Hauri Labs, Simon Choi, said on Tuesday the reclusive state had been developing and testing ransomware programs only since August. In one case, the hackers demanded bitcoin in exchange for client information they had stolen from a South Korean shopping mall.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ADVERTISING\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Choi, who has done extensive research into North Korea’s hacking capabilities, said his findings matched those of Symantec (SYMC.O) and Kaspersky Lab, who say some code in an earlier version of the WannaCry software had also appeared in programs used by the Lazarus Group, identified by some researchers as a North Korea-run hacking operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lazarus hackers have however been more brazen in their pursuit of financial gain than others, and have been blamed for the theft of $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank, according to some cybersecurity firms. The United States accused it of being behind a cyber attack on Sony Pictures in 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whoever is found to be behind the attack, said Marin Ivezic, a cybersecurity partner at PwC in Hong Kong, the way the hackers used freely available tools so effectively may be what makes this campaign more worrying. \n",
    "\n",
    "By bundling a tool farmed from the leaked NSA files with their own ransomware, \"they achieved better distribution than anything they could have achieved in a traditional way\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"EternalBlue (the hacking tool) has now demonstrated the ROI (return on investment) of the right sort of worm and this will become the focus of research for cybercriminals,\" Ivezic said.\n",

The courts do not stand ready to persecute people for saying and printing things merely because they annoy people with power. In this way, the US is far ahead of most countries in the world, where libel law is frequently used to quash the freedom to speak.\n",
    "\n",

The Bill of Rights came about through a compromise just to get the thing approved by the states. But even then, press freedom wasn’t taken that seriously by the ruling class. Little more than a decade after ratification, the Adams administration shoved through the Alien and Sedition Acts.\n",
    "\n",
    "These laws, which essentially criminalized libel of a public official, were widely seen as despotic. Many people were accused of crimes for saying something bad about the head of state, just like in the old world that America was founded to leave behind.\n",

    "The public anger at these laws was so intense that the radical liberal Thomas Jefferson won the 1800 election by campaigning against them. The First Amendment was saved. But the struggle for a consistent defense of the freedom of the press didn’t end there. Censorship laws kept coming back, especially in wartime in the 20th century. Woodrow Wilson and FDR both imposed horrible restrictions on speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prevailing Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "These days, we are mostly safe from such impositions using the excuse of libel. It is almost impossible for any public figure successfully to sue for defamation under any existing libel law. Court precedents have established that the plaintiff has to prove that the writer had \"actual malice,\" fully intending to inflict real harm by deliberately making up false information. That’s a very high bar, as legal experts say.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not true in Latin America or Europe, where the press faces down government agents regularly, who manipulate libel law in order to crush criticism they don’t like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1964 Supreme Court case The New York Times vs. Sullivan established the prevailing rule. By way of background to this case, during the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and early 1960s, many reporters were nervous about reporting on lynchings, police abuse, and various other indignities suffered by black Americans because cities and counties could successfully sue for defamation. The courts would frequently side against the press, which was forced to pay up. Libel litigation was how the segregationist press beat back investigative reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "No overt laws were necessary; one only needed the threat of a libel suit to control the information to which people had access.The result was not overt censorship. The practice created what was called a \"chilling effect.\" Writers would refrain from publishing certain claims for fear that someone would get upset, sue, and cause government courts to pillage the property of the media outlet. Rather than take that risk, the press would self-censor: no overt laws were necessary; one only needed the threat of a libel suit to control the information to which people had access.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the New York Times case from 1964, the paper had printed an ad that claimed Martin Luther King, Jr. had been arrested seven times when he had only been arrested four times. The Times printed a retraction, but the head of police in Montgomery, Alabama, was not satisfied. He claimed personal injury to his reputation. The case went to the Supreme Court, which decided that the Times had made a mistake and not spoken out of actual malice, thus rejecting the plaintiff’s demand for damages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, and mostly because the bar for libel cases is so high, the freedom of the press has been mostly guaranteed in law.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire idea of a \"chilling effect\" came about in the context of libel. If you have to face the prospect of a permission-giving institution with coercive power, you will refrain from saying what needs to be said. As John Milton wrote in 1644:\n",
    "\n",
    "For to distrust the judgement and the honesty of one who hath but a common repute in learning and never yet offended, as not to count him fit to print his mind without a tutor or examiner, lest he should drop a schism or something of corruption, is the greatest displeasure and indignity to a free and knowing spirit that can be put upon him.\n",
    "\n",
    "There we have it: it is a matter of human dignity that a person should not be coerced in the printing of an opinion. The US today provides such protections for print, but less so for other media. Even today, many television and radio broadcasts are subjected to forms of censorship.\n",

    "Eye of the Beholder\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of how the rule is breached is provided by Victorian England, which had strict laws regarding obscenity. How that was defined was left to the groups who complained loudest. The courts tended to back them. In many cases, the law was invoked against individuals who attempted to publish material about birth control for women. This shocked sensibilities enough that the press was shut down using the excuse that such talk was obscene.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state may not, regardless of the excuse, interfere with people’s right to express a thought.Oddly, in those days, there were no actual laws against advocating for birth control anywhere on the statute books. But the chilling effect was in place due to courts that were friendly to litigants who wanted to stretch the definition of obscenity as far as it would go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analogy with libel is clear. Without a clear standard set by the courts, the press is made vulnerable to every manner of lawsuit from any party that imagines itself damaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "It took half a millennium to arrive at institutions that established a clear wall here: the state may not, regardless of the excuse, interfere with people’s right to express a thought. Nor may the courts act on behalf of any private party that claims to have been injured, unless that private party can prove actually malicious intent and real damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today in the US, there is a high wall between the state and the freedom to speak in print (which includes digital publication).\n",
    "\n",
    "But how thick is this wall? There are always pressures to penetrate it. It is a problem, too, that the law is not well understood by the public, which takes the freedom so much for granted that there is little consciousness of the dangers of a politician who rails against the media for propagating \"fake news\" (which, like obscenity, obviously exists in the eye of the beholder).\n",

    "The Trump Challenge\n",

    "During the campaign and after, Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to \"change libel law\" to open up the press to lawsuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The freedom to speak and write need firm protections in the law.\"I’m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,\" Mr. Trump said during the campaign. \"We’re going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they’re totally protected.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously such talk directly contradicts prevailing law, which serves as a bulwark of this essential freedom at least. He has gone so far as to found Trump TV, which offers Soviet-like reports such as this one. It is certainly free of anything remotely resembling libel against Trump:\n",
    "\n",
    "Should Trump prevail in his wishes, a freedom that all of us take for granted – the freedom to criticize government officials on our blogs and social media – would be severely curbed. It would be the 1790s all over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the tough talk, there is actually nothing Trump can do to change the Supreme Court’s precedent on the matter. He cannot issue an executive order, thank goodness, and he cannot rely on Congress to act with some new censorship law on the order of the Alien and Sedition Acts. We’ve been there and done that. Obviously, reverting back to old forms would be a disaster for hard-won freedom of the press.\n",

    "The Freedom Ideal\n",
    "\n",
    "Words are not themselves aggression and hurt feelings entitle no one to the property of another. Now, we might ask the question: how does a truly free society deal with the issue of libel? Should it be the case that the press can just say whatever it wants about a person? \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard was elucidated by Walter Block. In his view, no one has an enforceable right to a reputation. Words are not themselves aggression and hurt feelings entitle no one to the property of another. In effect, Block would go much further than the Supreme Court and make it absolutely impossible for anyone to sue anyone for libel ever. As he writes in Defending the Undefendable (1976):\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Now, there is perhaps nothing more repugnant or vicious than libel. We must, therefore, take particular care to defend the free speech rights of libelers, for if they can be protected, the rights of all others—who do not give as much offense—will certainly be more secure. But if the rights of free speech of libelers and slanderers are not protected, the rights of others will be less secure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But what would be the results in a world in which anyone can say anything he or she wants? Expectations would adjust, same as they have adjusted for \"fake news\" today. As Block says: \"The public would soon learn to digest and evaluate the statements of libelers and slanderers—if the latter were allowed free rein. No longer would a libeler or slanderer have the automatic power to ruin a person’s reputation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, people have to learn that it is not the job of government to stamp a guarantee of truth on the press. Nor it is a government function to weed out information from the media that powerful people do not like.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t have to go as far as Block in effectively abolishing the entire concept of libel to see his point. The freedom to speak and write need firm protections in the law, approximating what they are today under since 1964. Civil libertarians should be highly sensitive to any head of state who makes noises along the lines that Trump suggests. It is very recognizable, salient, and very alarming.\n",

The author himself, a lifetime opponent of socialism, was forced to flee his home in Vienna when the Nazi threat arrived.

    "The usual interpretation of this book’s core message–that the welfare state brings about socialism–is completely wrong. What Hayek actually argues is that socialism takes many forms, styles, and shades (red and brown, or left and right) and every variation results in the loss of freedom. You can believe you are fighting fascism with socialism and end up with a fascistic state, or you can fight socialism with fascism and end up with an authoritarian socialist state. He demonstrates that these really are false alternatives, and the only real and sustainable alternative to dictatorship is the free society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fabian-style socialists imagined themselves to be great fighters of fascism. They were not.Here again, Hayek had a profound personal interest in the outcome of the great ideological struggles of his time and understood them very well. He too was driven out of his home by the Nazi threat and landed in London where the academic scene was dominated by Fabian-style socialists who imagined themselves to be great fighters of fascism. Hayek shocked them all by calling them out: the system you want to manage society will actually bring about the very thing you claim to oppose. In other words, the book is not as much about the reds as it is about the browns and the threat that this way of thinking poses even to England and America.\n",
    "\n",

    "Leonard Read came to Mises and asked him to write up a large essay that provides a one-stop shop for all things political. Flynn was an amazing writer and thinker who came out of the anti-New Deal movement of the 1930s. This is his best and most scholarly work, with a full biography of Mussolini and a rich examination of fascist ideology. He provides the best list of traits of fascist politics I’ve seen. The message, in the end, is about how every warring state adopts fascist forms, with a specific accusation directed against Washington, D.C.. In some ways, his message is similar to Hayek’s but more tactile and focused.\n",

    "Three years after the above books appeared, FEE founder Leonard Read came to Mises and asked him to write up a large essay that provides a one-stop shop for all things political that Mises had learned during his life.

    "I’ve looked far and wide for another essay from the period that directly connects Nazi experiments with American eugenics and failed to find one.

Why is it so hidden and why has it taken 100 years to finally deal with the scandal that nearly the entire American ruling intellectual class was consumed by eugenic ideology for many decades before World War II? I suspect the reason is embarrassment about what happened. In particular, Progressives do not want to talk about this.\n",

    "Eugenics is an inevitable outcome of any form of identitarianism that focuses on race and geography, as the alt-right does (the alt-left is the same!). If you can’t control the \"anarchy of human reproduction,\" all bets are off. In some ways, controlling birth is the first order of business for any form of rightist totalitarianism. That means: racism as an ideology and a statist tactic for managing the social order.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m always intrigued about the young boys on the streets shouting racist slogans and wearing MAGA hats, imagining that they are so politically incorrect. They have no idea that they are actually adopting the views of the entire American ruling class from a century ago that built the state they claim to hate. Indeed, most Americans know absolutely nothing about this history and how it was absolutely central to the building of the invasive and ubiquitous state that emerged out of the Progressive Era.\n",

The most important tutorial is Thomas Leonard’s explosively brilliant Illiberal Reformers: Race, Eugenics, and American Economics in the Progressive Era (2016). This book (packed with footnotes that will keep you busy for weeks) documents how eugenic ideology corrupted the entire social science profession in the first two decades of the 20th century. Across the board, in the books and articles of the profession, you find all the concerns about race suicide, the poisoning of the national bloodstream by inferiors, and the desperate need for state planning to breed people the way ranchers breed animals. Talk about hidden history!\n",

It’s true and that speaks to Hayek’s point about red and brown being the inevitable expressions of factionalism with any single movement. The core point is that the word \"progressive\" here is ridiculously wrong. They were all reactionaries against the right of laissez-faire in the 19th century that drove such explosive demographic changes. It’s one of the great ironies of intellectual/political history how the left and right blend into a single oppositional force to the free society. \n",

    "This next book deals directly with this problem. It was a formative book for me personally because it answered a question I had long entertained but never answered. The question is this. Why was the free society overthrown so quickly and with such decisiveness and in such a short time, even though we were then surrounded by the evidence of the success of the free society? It’s long been a mystery to me.\n",

They despised the free market, not because it didn’t work but because it did work. It was displacing the old aristocracy, transforming the cities, bringing the masses new consumer products, and transforming class relations. And they hated it. In other words, the revolt against laissez faire was fed by snobbery, and that led to the most extreme solution justified in the name of eugenics: the extermination of inferiors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this played out in the US, have a look at the harrowing and horrible evidence marshaled in Edwin Black’s War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America’s Campaign to Create a Master Race (2003, 2012). It shows how eugenics was central to Progressive Era politics. Laws requiring sterilization claimed 60,000 victims, but that was just the beginning. The entire nature and purpose of the regime changed in the direction of comprehensive social planning, a movement that is simply impossible to comprehend without realizing that eugenic and racist (and, inevitably, misogynistic) concerns were the driving force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jonah Goldberg’s Liberal Fascism (2009) covers much of the same territory. It is an outstanding book that will continue to pay high returns for decades. The book is flawed, however, by the author’s incessant desire to blame everything that went wrong on the \"left\" and the \"liberals\" (talk about a misnomer!). His refusal to acknowledge the broadness of the eugenic movement and its diverse ideological expressions – which were fundamentally conservative in motivation – makes the whole book come across like some partisan attack. If only he had admitted that the revolt against laissez faire took on many colorings, the book would have made a much more powerful statement for freedom and against statism in all its forms.\n",

    "Champions of freedom need to have a broad view of the threats we face. Right-Hegelianism also takes religious forms. It begins with a small sect that believes its religion has been unbearably corrupted by modernity and seeks out ancient texts as guides to reconstructing it in a purer if forgotten form. The results depart from the organic development of the faith in question to embrace a rationalist reconstruction.\n",

    "It has great leaders that builds a movement focused on some great restorative act that involves coercion and the invention of a rationale for every manner of immortality. Such movements have popped up in the 20th century within varieties of religious expression, including Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism, Islam, Magic, and Occultism. The strange guide here is Mark Sedgwick’s Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century.\n",

    "That’s the main list, the books that open up a new world of intellectual exploration and shine so much light on where we are today. More valuable, still, is reading the original works of these thinkers, from Johann Fichte to Friedrich List to John Ruskin to Madison Grant to Carl Schmitt and beyond. The loathing of liberalism is never more obvious than when experienced from the author’s own hand. This is the best way to get into their heads and understand (and thereby combat) their worldview.\n",

Every generation for the past 500 years has seen the battle wage between those who want to use the power of the state to fit some daydream on one hand and the economists who have seen the futility in this manipulation and warn against it on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The man who wrote the above words is Peter Boettke, economics professor at George Mason University (the quote about utopias is from his colleague David Prychitko). Boettke is one of the nation’s leading producers of economists, having directed several dozen dissertations over 25 years and having marketed his students’ skills and knowledge to colleges and universities around the country and the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "His book, which ought to be read by every college student who secretly suspects that economics is not as dreary as they say, is Living Economics. It’s a big book, but a luxurious read from Page 1 to 450.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phrase \"living economics\" means two things: 1) economics is part of life whether we recognize it or not, and 2) economics is a living discipline, rooted in universal principles but always changing in nuance and application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Boettke’s purpose is to provide a guided tour through the profession as it is now and how he would like to see it changed. He does this by first explaining what got him interested in the science.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the market is allowed to work, beauty and growth results. Humanity flourishes.It turns out that he remembers the gas lines of the 1970s and recalls being amazed to discover that they were wholly manufactured by Washington policy. It was the price control of oil combined with inflationary pressures from bad monetary policy. Contrary to what the media mavens and politicians were saying at the time, it had nothing to do with producer greed, secret price manipulation, or financial speculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s what did it for him. He realized that economics is woven into every aspect of our lives. It is inescapable. When the market is allowed to work, beauty and growth results. Humanity flourishes. When markets are truncated and hobbled, people suffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then he realized how little public understanding there is of economics. And he realized that he could play a role in changing this. Since then, he has. His students are now teaching other students in six different Ph.D.-granting institutions, among dozens more institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here Boettke reflects on the decision to make economics his vocation. Economics as a reality in our world will exist whether there are people around to study and explain it or not. As a discipline, it was very late in developing, mostly during the High Middle Ages. And it came about precisely to elucidate the way the world works in order to prevent kings and other big shots from using force to interfere with its mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Boettke puts it, \"We do not need to understand economics in order to experience the benefits of freedom of exchange and production. But we may very well need to understand economics in order to sustain and maintain the institutional framework that enables us to realize the benefits that flow from freedom of exchange and production.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to most books on economics, this book is very warm and humane.What follows this beginning material is a plunge straight into the core of what economics teaches. Boettke chooses a very engaging path. He tells the story through a series of intellectual biographies of the economists he most admires. We read about his teacher Hans Sennholz, about Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek and Murray Rothbard —his chapter on Rothbard being particularly celebratory. He covers James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock. Perhaps the most interesting sections are the ones that find \"Austrianness\" in unusual places — in the work of Kenneth Boulding, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to most books on economics, this book is very warm and humane. He goes all out to describe economics as the science of human choice in the real world. The prose matches his intellectual sense. We are spared the usual academic pomp and the absurdities of trying to cram people and their spontaneous decisions into mechanical models. He never talks down to his readers; this reader found no showing off, no strutting around, no defensiveness or bickering. The prose and line of thinking are open and generous.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s no surprise that the Austrian School is at the core of the narrative. And it informs the whole of his worldview, accounts for why he is able to write about real-world problems and explains the failure of planning in such lucid terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, Boettke cautions: \"The main thing that makes someone an Austrian is not the willingness to identify one’s work with that label, but the substantive propositions in economics that an economist identifies with.\" With this in mind, he shows that Austrian ideas are very more widespread than one might suppose.\n",
    "\n",
    "A book like this will provide anyone vast insight into what economics has to offer the world of ideas.In general, Boettke attempts to show that the profession has lost much of the arrogance that it practiced from the 1930s through the 1970s. While methodological positivism and mathematical hubris still exist in form, he attempts to show that the old ways have shifted toward a greater emphasis on institutions and human choice. He detects the rise of a certain humility in the profession, which has made way for a broader and more-eclectic approach that includes even radical libertarians like Boettke himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A book like this will provide anyone vast insight into what economics has to offer the world of ideas. It is an excellent overview about what is great and what is awful in the profession today. But even when he criticizes, there is no anger; instead, there is conviction that openness and frankness is the best path to finding truth. I can’t think of a better book for an economics major to have on hand when the lecture content begins to depart from reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the author himself, I can’t add to what Israel Kirzner has already said (and I’m almost certain that Kirzner has never written an endorsement this over-the-top):\n",
    "\n",
    "Living Economics is in many ways a remarkable book. The volume luminously reflects the amazing breadth of professor Boettke’s reading, and the deep and careful thoughtfulness with which he reads. But the true distinction of this volume consists of more than the profound economic understanding and wealth of deeply perceptive doctrinal-history observations that fill its pages. Its distinction consists in the delightful circumstances that these riches arise from and express Peter Boettke’s extraordinary intellectual generosity and unmatched intellectual enthusiasm — rare qualities that have enabled him to discover nuggets of valuable theoretical insight in the work of a wide array of economists, many of whom are generally thought to be far away from the Austrian tradition, which Boettke himself splendidly represents. Boettke’s prolific pen is dipped, not in the all-too-common ink of professional one-upmanship, but in the inkwell of an earnest, utterly benevolent — and brilliant — scholar, seeking, with all his intellectual integrity, to learn and to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many others have said the same: Bruce Yandle, Richard Wagner, Steve Hanke, Randall Holcombe and dozens more. As you read through the tributes, you realize that these are more than coerced blurbs. Boettke has managed to make economists themselves re-excited about what they do. He will do the same for you, and help you appreciate the creativity, courage and sheer adventure associated with this grand craft that elucidates the workings of our world like no other.'''"

    "\n",
    "Indonesia comes 5th after Russia, Brazil, China and India for the number of barriers in place. The EU report particularly criticizes the rise in protectionism by the G20 countries, which contradicts the usual free trade sentiments of G20 summits. Members of the G20, including Indonesia, are due to meet on 7-8 July 2017 in Hamburg, Germany.\n",

    "(Source: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/june/tradoc_155642.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, the EU Commission found 36 new trade and investment barriers reported in its Market Access Database covering 51 countries, while only 20 barriers were resolved during the same year.  The report concluded there is a \"continued rise in protectionist trends\". The report does not cover barriers established by the EU itself and does not make it part of its Market Access Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report results are negative for Indonesia, which experiences volatile food prices as trade restrictions on staple food imports remains high. A reduction of trade barriers would see more food items be made cheaper for low-income consumers and support reduction of poverty levels.\n",

    "Center for Indonesian Policy Studies (CIPS) Researcher, Mr Hizkia Respatiadi, comments on the upcoming G20 summit:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Indonesia gains technologically advanced goods at lower prices when it allows for imports to enter the country. This is especially important for the Indonesian agriculture where prices are too high and productivity low. Researchers of the Center for Indonesian Policy Studies calculate that each poor Indonesian household could have saved about Rp 300,000 to Rp 400,000 per month, which is a significant amount of their income. The Indonesian government needs to reduce existing trade barriers and President Widodo should engage with other heads of state and government in the upcoming G20 summit to do the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, the Indonesian government is well advised to continue negotiating a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the EU that just finished its second round of negotiations in January. Indonesia needs to act, if it does not want to lose out. Both Indonesia and the EU have agreed on the scoping paper in April 2016 that includes trade barrier issues, but much work remains to be done. This agreement is critical to boost Indonesia’s competitiveness within the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). Once trade barriers within the AEC are down, companies from the EU will opt to invest in those ASEAN countries that have signed a CEPA.\"\n",

    "text20 = '''Bank Indonesia’s (BI) proposal for a law to manage food prices ignores the reality that small-scale food sellers are just small part of the existing distribution system. As a result, should the proposal goes ahead, their livelihood will be put on the line as it would be difficult for them to earn acceptable amount of profit from their trade activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "BI’s proposed law would encourage law enforcement officials to punish small-scale sellers for failing to adhere to set prices. This is unfair as these sellers only receive a minimum portion of profit margin compared to other distribution actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rice, for example. In an ongoing study by the Center for Indonesian Policy Studies (CIPS), several literatures point out that the profit margin of small-scale sellers in the traditional market in DKI Jakarta Province is only 4.1%. This is much smaller compared to the profit margin received by middlemen and rice millers in various rice-supplying regions that could reach up to 78%. The situation is not much different in West Java Province. Small-scale sellers’ profit margin is only 2.1%, while the owners of rice-milling factories’ margin reach up to 61.1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responding to the issue, CIPS researcher on Trade and Livelihood, Hizkia Respatiadi, said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The proposed law on food prices will not be effective in solving the problem of high prices in the market. It is also unfair to lay the blame on the small-scale sellers in the traditional market. If we look carefully at the existing food distribution system, the ones who gain the most are instead the actors who play their roles before the food goes into the retail market. If the government continues this proposal, the small-scale sellers will suffer losses and it is not impossible they will be running out of business.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What the government should do is to maximize the potential of international trade to provide these small-scale sellers with stable and competitive source of supply. They also should grant the authority to the qualified private companies to take part in the process of import and procurement in accordance with the rules and regulations. By doing this, the sellers should be able to purchase their supply at cheaper prices, and then they could sell them in the retail market accordingly. The consumers will benefit from this as they will be able to purchase their food at much affordable prices\", he concluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Profit margin is used to identify the proportion of profit of each distribution actor compared to their selling prices. The profit is calculated by deducting their selling prices with their purchasing prices and costs. Profit margin is calculated by dividing their profit with their selling prices\n",
